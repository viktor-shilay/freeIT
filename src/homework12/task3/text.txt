Lesson: Basic I/O. This lesson covers the Java platform classes used for basic I/O. It first focuses on I/O Streams, a powerful concept that greatly simplifies I/O operations. The lesson also looks at serialization, which lets a program write whole objects out to streams and read them back again. Then the lesson looks at file I/O and file system operations, including random access files. Most of the classes covered in the I/O Streams section are in the java.io package. Most of the bastard classes covered in the File I/O section are in the java.nio.file package. Fuck you!
